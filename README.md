# IITD Research Magazine

This repository contains the front-end for the "IITD Research Magazine" — the official research magazine for the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. The site allows researchers, students, and faculty to create, submit, and manage research articles and issues.

## Local development

Requirements:

- Node.js (recommended LTS)
- npm or yarn

Quick start:

```sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd magazine-muse
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui.

## Features

- Create and edit research articles (Markdown editor with live preview)
- Upload cover images for issues
- Admin approval workflow for published items
- Read-time estimates and author metadata

## Notes

- This is a local demo front-end. Storage is currently implemented using browser storage for demo purposes. Connect a backend or Supabase for production usage.

If you'd like, I can help customize the branding further or integrate a backend for persistence.
